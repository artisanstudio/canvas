# Canvas

Canvas is a Laravel template that we use for most of our Laravel projects.

This comes with most of our basic needs in developing web apps from the backend, and front-end alike.

## Setup

```
composer install

yarn && yarn run dev

php artisan key:generate

php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

php artisan passport:install

```
